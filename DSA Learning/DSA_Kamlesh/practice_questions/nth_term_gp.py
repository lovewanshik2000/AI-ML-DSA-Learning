"""
Given three integers a, r, and n, where a is the first term of a geometric progression (GP), r is the common ratio, and n is the position of the term you need to find. Your task is to calculate the n-th term of the GP.
Since the result can be very large, return the answer modulo 1000000007 (i.e. 109+â€‰7).

Examples:

Input: a = 2, r = 2, n = 4
Output: 16
Explanation: The GP series is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,... in which 16 is the 4th term.
